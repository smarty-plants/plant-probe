## Setup

This project requires the VS Code PlatformIO extension to be opened, compiled and uploaded to the ESP8266.

Make sure drivers for the CH340 (serial chip used by the NodeMCU) are installed, or else you won't be able to upload code to the ESP8266! For Windows, click [here](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/4/CH341SER.EXE) to install the driver.
